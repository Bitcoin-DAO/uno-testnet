# Protocol test cases (draft)

These cases define what a correct btc-dao client must do with each kind of event (requirement S4). Each case gives the starting state, the events or input, and the expected result, with the protocol section it tests. Phase 1 turns every row into an automated test with real signed fixtures; a client is ready for a DAO only when all of them pass.

Cases marked with a gap number tested a rule `protocol.md` did not settle when they were first written. The [Findings](#findings) table records each gap and how it was resolved.

## Conventions

- **Base state** unless a case says otherwise: a DAO on testnet4; council A, B, C, D, E (threshold 3); founders F1, F2; rules version 1 (7-day vote, quorum 1/3, majority as in the config, monthly rounds in Europe/Rome time, lapse after 2 rounds, fee-rate cap 20 sat/vB, treasury cap 5,000,000 sats); roster version 1 = council + founders.
- `t0` is the time of the event under test; days are counted from it.
- "Rejected" means the event is kept, shown in the rejected view with the reason, and has no effect on state (section 8). "Ignored" means the client never treats it as part of this DAO.
- Every result must be the same whatever order the events arrive in, and whichever relays they come from.

## 1. All events

| ID | Case | Expected | § |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G-01 | The same event (same `id`) arrives from three relays | Counted once | 1.1 |
| G-02 | Event with a bad signature or an `id` that does not match its content | Rejected: invalid event | 1.1 |
| G-03 | Valid event whose `D` tag is another DAO's id | Ignored, not shown as rejected | 1.2 |
| G-04 | Event with no `D` tag, or two `D` tags | Ignored | 1.2 |
| G-05 | Event with `["v","2"]` | Not applied; the client says it needs an update | 1.2 |
| G-06 | `content` that is not valid JSON, or valid JSON missing a required field | Rejected: malformed | 1.1 |
| G-07 | All events delivered newest first, then in random order | Same state as when delivered oldest first | 8 |

## 2. Genesis and endorsements

| ID | Case | Expected | § |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-01 | Genesis whose content hashes to its `D` tag, endorsed by A, B, C | DAO exists; roster v1 = A–E + F1, F2; rules v1 from config | 3.1, 3.5 |
| F-02 | Same genesis endorsed by A and B only | DAO not yet founded; founders' apps keep waiting | 3.1 |
| F-03 | Genesis content changed by one character after the DAO id was fixed | Rejected: hash does not match `D` | 1.3, 3.1 |
| F-04 | Endorsement of the genesis by a key not in its `council` | Does not count | 3.2 |
| F-05 | A endorses the genesis twice | Counts once | 3.2 |
| F-06 | Endorsement whose `hash` does not match the endorsed event's content | Rejected | 3.2 |
| F-07 | Genesis published by F1 (a founder not on the council) | Rejected (Gap 1) | 3.1 |
| F-08 | Founder's browser holds a key not listed in the endorsed genesis | No keywrap and no card offered; app says to contact the council | 3.5 |
| F-09 | Founder's browser sees the endorsed genesis | Publishes one `dao.keywrap`; card offered with the right `dao8` | 3.5 |

## 3. Rosters and rules

| ID | Case | Expected | § |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-01 | Roster v2 adds member M, basis = passed and tallied add-member proposal, endorsed by 3 | Accepted; M is a member from the third endorsement | 3.3 |
| R-02 | Roster v2 adds M with no basis | Rejected | 3.3 |
| R-03 | Roster v2 adds M and also drops F2, basis covers only M | Rejected as a whole | 3.3 |
| R-04 | Roster v3 published while v2 does not exist | Rejected: version gap | 3.3 |
| R-05 | Roster v2 whose `prev` is not the hash of v1 | Rejected | 3.3 |
| R-06 | Roster v2 endorsed by only 2 council members | Not in effect | 3.2, 3.3 |
| R-07 | Two different roster v2 events, each with 3 endorsements (one council member endorsed both) | Both disputed until the council endorses a v3 that names one as `prev`; the double endorser is flagged (Gap 2) | 3.3 |
| R-08 | Roster v2 drops F2, basis = F2's valid `dao.leave` | Accepted | 3.3, 5.3 |
| R-09 | Roster v2 replaces F1's key, basis = endorsed `dao.rekey` | Accepted; F1 keeps name, `since` and history | 3.3, 5.2 |
| R-10 | Roster changes council flags after a passed change-council proposal whose migration has a receipt | Accepted; settings version with the new council and descriptor endorsed alongside (Gap 3) | 3.3, 3.4 |
| R-11 | Settings v2, basis = passed and tallied change-rules proposal, endorsed by 3 | Accepted from the third endorsement; proposals published earlier keep the settings version they started under | 3.4 |
| R-12 | Settings v2 changes a value the proposal did not name | Rejected | 3.4 |
| R-13 | Settings v2 with a new council and descriptor, but the migration round has no receipt yet | Not in effect | 3.4 |

## 4. Proposals

| P-12 | Add-member proposal whose verification is for a different key | Rejected | 4.1 |
| P-13 | Payout to a member (recipient is F1) | F1's vote counts like any other (Gap 5 dropped) | 4.3 |

| P-19 | Change-council with `in_key` already on the council, or not on the roster | Rejected | 4.1.2 |
| P-20 | Change-council, reason `recall`, `out_key` A, no incoming key, threshold 3, new 3-of-4 descriptor | Accepted | 4.1.2 |
| P-21 | Change-council shrinking to four keys with threshold 5 | Rejected: threshold above council size | 4.1.2 |
| P-22 | Change-council with both keys `null` and reason `resignation` | Rejected: a threshold-only change needs reason `threshold` | 4.1.2 |
| P-23 | Change-council with no `reason` | Rejected | 4.1.2 |

## 5. Recipient confirmations

| ID | Case | Expected | § |

| C-02 | Confirmation of an address not in the outputs | Rejected | 4.2 |
| C-03 | Payout to a non-proposer passes with no confirmation | Not eligible for a round; status "waiting for confirmation" | 4.2 |

| C-S07 | F1 publishes `{"standing": false}` | No standing address; later rounds need per-proposal confirmations | 4.2 |
| C-S08 | F1 leaves, is removed, or has their key replaced | Standing address ends at that moment; the new key has none | 4.2, 5.2, 5.3 |

| C-S10 | Round published including an output covered only by a standing address that was withdrawn before the round | Sign refused | 4.2, 6.1 |

## 6. Votes

| ID | Case | Expected | § |

| V-10 | Every eligible member has voted yes by day 2 | Vote stays open until day 7; a member may still change their vote (Gap 9) | 4.3 |

## 7. Tallies

| T-05 | Tally whose `closed_at` differs from the computed close | Rejected | 4.4 |
| T-06 | Client holds a vote dated before the close that the tally neither counts nor excludes | Tally stands; proposal shows a warning | 4.4 |
| T-07 | Second, different tally by B | Proposal Disputed; no payout, roster or rules change acts on it | 4.4 |
| T-08 | Disputed proposal, then 3 council endorsements of B's tally | B's tally stands (Gap 10) | 3.2, 4.4 |
| T-10 | Tally whose `number` differs from the derived proposal number | Rejected | 4.4 |
| T-09 | A publishes the same tally twice | Counts once; not a dispute | 4.4 |
| T-09c | A's and B's apps both publish tallies with identical `counted`, `excluded` and `result` | One tally; not a dispute | 4.4 |
| T-09d | No council member has opened the app since the close | No tally yet; the first council app opened publishes it | 4.4 |

## 8. Verification, key replacement, leaving

| K-02 | Keywrap signed by a key not on the roster and with no verification | Rejected | 5.4 |
| K-03 | Two keywraps for the same credential | The later one counts | 5.4 |
| K-04 | Passkey sign-in on a new phone; keywrap fetched and opened | Same identity key; nothing to type | 1.5 |
| K-05 | Keywrap opened with a different passkey's output | Decryption fails; app offers the card or key replacement | 1.5 |
| K-06 | Keywrap events of another DAO with the same credential | Not used; the salt differs per DAO | 1.5 |

## 10. Identity cards

## 15. Discovery and dashboard reconciliation

Cases for the app's publishing to discovery relays and for any dashboard. "Dashboard" means any client that implements `dashboard-spec.md`.

| ID | Case | Expected | § |

| Q-01 | Listing with `"listed": true` reaches 3 endorsements | App publishes the listing and its 3 endorsements to the shipped discovery relays as well as the DAO's own relays | 7.4 |
| Q-02 | Listing with `"listed": false`, or without `listed` | App does not publish it to discovery relays | 7.4 |
| Q-03 | Dashboard finds a listing on a discovery relay | Fetches the DAO's events by `#D` from the listing's `relays`, verifies genesis, settings and the listing's endorsements, then shows the DAO | 7.4, 8 |
| Q-04 | Listing on a discovery relay whose endorsements are not by the DAO's council | Not shown | 7.4, 3.2 |
| Q-05 | Listing on a discovery relay whose `relays` cannot be reached | Not shown until the DAO's events can be verified | 7.4 |
| Q-06 | Listed DAO whose genesis `stage` is `practice` or `testnet` | Shown apart from mainnet DAOs; left out of network totals | 7.4 |
| Q-07 | Listed DAO whose settings have no `fundingModel`, or an unknown value | Shown with funding model "not stated" | 3.4, dashboard spec 5 |
| Q-08 | Listed DAO, 12 complete months, one donation of 10× its usual monthly income in one month | Steady I/O unchanged by the donation; the 12-month total in shows it | dashboard spec 2a |

| N-02 | Spend in the mempool, no matching round seen yet | Pending match | dashboard spec 2 |
| N-03 | Confirmed spend, no matching round after the grace period | Unauthorised; network and DAO counters go up by one, linked to the transaction | dashboard spec 2 |
| N-04 | Spend from an earlier descriptor matching a valid sweep round | Authorised | 6.1 |
| N-05 | Two rounds share an input; one confirms | Confirmed one authorised; the other shown void, not unauthorised | 6.1 |
| N-06 | Matching round arrives after the spend was marked unauthorised | Re-marked authorised; the change shown in the DAO's history | dashboard spec 2 |
| N-07 | Receipt names a txid the chain does not confirm at that height | Receipt rejected; reconciliation uses the chain, not the receipt | 6.3 |

## Test vectors

Phase 1 adds full signed fixtures for every case above: a genesis, rosters, proposals, votes, tallies and a testnet4 PSBT round, each as raw Nostr events.

## Findings

Writing the cases turned up twelve rules the protocol did not settle. All are now resolved in `protocol.md`.

| Gap | Problem | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Anyone could publish a genesis | Only a key in the genesis `council` may publish it |
| 2 | Two different versions of the roster or rules can each reach 3 endorsements if one council member endorses both | Both are disputed until the council endorses a next version that names one as `prev`; endorsing two conflicting versions is flagged |
| 3 | After a council change, nothing records the new council keys and descriptor, and the roster basis list does not include change-council proposals | `dao.rules` became `dao.settings`, holding rules, council, threshold and descriptor; change-council is a roster basis once its migration has a receipt |
| 4 | Proposal numbers follow `created_at`, which the proposer chooses, so a backdated proposal renumbers later ones | Each tally records its proposal's number, which then never changes; a proposal dated before the most recent tallied proposal is rejected. Numbers can then shift only among proposals still open, and only through an obvious backdating that the app flags |
| 5 | The payout payload has no recipient key, so "payout to a member" cannot be detected | Dropped: a member may vote on a payout to themselves, so no recipient key is needed |
| 6 | "Lapse after 2 rounds" has no starting point | Count round dates (the 1st of each month) after the tally |
| 7 | A member whose key was replaced mid-vote cannot vote with the new key | Eligibility follows the person through key replacements: the new key inherits the old key's eligibility and its latest vote |
| 8 | "Active member" in the quorum is undefined | Quorum = one third of eligible voters, rounded up; the "inactive member" status is removed |
| 9 | Early close conflicts with changing votes | Drop early close: every vote runs its full period |
| 10 | Tally endorsements are used in 4.4 but `tally` is not an endorsement object in 3.2 | Add `tally` to the objects in 3.2 |
| 11 | Card payload case and spacing are not specified for scanning | Scanners accept any case and trim spaces; printing stays upper case |
| 12 | Two open rounds can include the same proposal and both confirm | One open round at a time; a replacement round must spend one of the open round's inputs, so only one can ever confirm |
