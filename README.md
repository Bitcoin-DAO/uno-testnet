# UNO DAO

**This is UNO DAO's own copy of [btc-dao](https://github.com/Bitcoin-DAO/btc-dao) on testnet4.** It runs btc-dao v0.2.0 (commit d562207). The site is at **https://bitcoin-dao.github.io/uno-testnet** and is built from `config/dao.json` by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. Code changes are made in btc-dao and pulled in here; only `config/dao.json`, the charter (`config/charter.it.md`, `config/charter.en.md`) and this note are UNO DAO's own.

**One site for practice and testnet.** UNO DAO replaces the separate practice copy (`uno-practice`, closed on 8 November 2026 after a full run). The founders choose **practice** (10-minute votes) at founding; the members move to **live** 3-day votes by a rule-change vote, and later from phone test keys to SeedSigners by a council change. The DAO, its members and its record carry on throughout. The mainnet DAO that follows is a separate site.

**Chain sources:** the DAO's chain gateway first (`btc-dao-gateway`), mempool.space directly as a fallback.

After founding, add `"daoId": "<the DAO id shown on the setup page>"` to `config/dao.json`, and the id to the relay's list.

# btc-dao

A SputnikDAO-style DAO on Bitcoin alone: members propose and vote, a council of keyholders signs payouts from a multisig treasury, and anyone can audit everything.

- **Bitcoin only.** The treasury is an on-chain 3-of-5 multisig. No tokens, no other chain.
- **Approval is execution.** A payout is a PSBT; council signatures are the binding vote.
- **Keyless software.** The website never holds a key that can move funds.
- **Voters and keyholders are separate.** Members vote with a passkey on their phone; only the council's hardware keys can sign for the treasury.
- **One DAO per codebase.** Each DAO forks this repo and owns its hosting, relays and keys. There is no shared platform.
- **Always recoverable.** With the recovery sheet and 3 council seeds, any standard wallet (e.g. Sparrow) can recover the funds without this software.

## Status

**Testnet4 prototype, stages 1–3 built.** The app (`app/`) covers founding, passkey sign-in, identity cards, the treasury page, proposals and votes, new members, leaving, key replacement, and payout rounds signed by the council and broadcast on testnet4. Next: the phase 1 gate, a real testnet4 payout run by five testers. The DAO relay runs on Cloudflare. The first instance is **UNO**, the trial DAO that runs the practice and testnet stages; the mainnet DAO that follows is named by its council.

Every DAO goes through three stages, each a separate DAO with its own tested build: a **practice** run on testnet4 with ten-minute votes, the **testnet** DAO with the real rules, and the **mainnet** DAO. The first two run on coins from the BTC DAO Testnet Treasury, end by closing the DAO and returning them, and are thrown away. See [`docs/guide.md`](docs/guide.md#8-the-three-stages-practice-testnet-mainnet).

Nothing here is ready for real funds.

## Build plan

1. **Testnet4 prototype**: passkey sign-in, proposals and votes as Nostr events, 3-of-5 testnet4 treasury, payout round end to end; site on GitHub Pages, relay on Nosflare.
2. **Hardware signing on testnet4**: SeedSigner QR signing, recovery sheet, restore tested in Sparrow.
3. **The first DAO on mainnet**: key ceremony, capped treasury, three monthly rounds without developer help.
4. **Fork kit**: setup wizard, template repo, one-click deploy, dashboard listing.

## Licence

Not yet chosen. The licence is added last, once the fork tasks are done and the code is field-tested.
